In reality, America is backing Chiang's utterly corrupt regime in the belief that the Generalissimo is bound to win a Civil War. But Mao is also looking West, towards America. Rittenberg becomes directly involved in these secret overtures. He dreams of becoming a bridge between America a new China. But nobody in Washington is really listening. In scenes with General Marshall and President Truman we see how America stumbled yet again into a disastrous foreign policy blunder. Rittenberg treks north, to Mao's base in Yan'an. He meets Mao. Mao gives him a job. He also hooks up again with Yulin. They fall in love. They marry. Civil War erupts. Rittenberg and Yulin are with Mao as he inflicts defeat after defeat on Chiang's forces. America has backed the wrong horse. As Mao's army claims victory and the Generalissimo flees the country, Rittenberg's dream is still alive. He is ordered to Beijing. He believes that this is his moment. It's a cruel deception. After America had ignored Mao's overtures, the Chinese saw no choice but to renew their old alliance with the Russians. On orders from Moscow, Rittenberg is arrested as an American spy. He experiences for himself the dark and deadly side of the movement to which he has pledged his full allegiance: the nightmare of the Chinese Communist penal system. On Stalin's death, in 1953, Rittenberg is released. He stays in China. He stays with Yulin. All this is true. It is historical fact. And Sidney Rittenberg is still going strong, at 93 - a living witness to the revolution that changed the world and that we see, in this movie, for the first time, from a completely fresh perspective.

70 ::: Tim Minchin: So Live (2007) ::: Tim Minchin's live concert captured for this DVD, performed at the Sydney Opera House, in one of the smaller Studio Theatre rooms. This is an intimate show and the vibe within the venue is a little proper, but they do seem to enjoy themselves. Tim's act is a compilation of pieces from his successful stage shows Dark Side and So Rock, combining spoken stand-up routines with hilariously witty musical numbers on the piano - an instrument on which Tim is clearly more than adept. To my mind, Tim's comedic forte combines the 'rock' aspirations of Tenacious D with the supreme wit and cabaret-style musical flair of Neil Innes' Bonzo Dog Band. He's a fantastic musician, an intelligent, thought-provoking lyricist and a side-splittingly hilarious showman.

138 ::: Winter's Watch (2017) ::: Located ten miles off the coast of mainland New England, the Oceanic Hotel is the grand, yet far-from-modern home to the thousands of guests who brave the choppy seas to visit during the warmer spring and summer months. Off-season, the hotel and the 43-acre Star Island on which it sits is home to one woman - its winter caretaker who braves the colder, darker months of inclement weather by embracing the solitude and finding inspiration, and life, in what would otherwise be considered the 'bones' of winter. Intrepid photographer Alexandra de Steiguer embraces five cold months of solitude year after year on a remote island group miles off the coast of Maine in her role as winter caretaker. Since 1997, Star Island in the Isles of Shoals has had this lone winter resident sharing a very small world with only the seals, seabirds, twenty-nine historic buildings, and a landscape so spare and forbidding that the viewer finds it difficult to believe that nearly twenty years of inspiration could come from such a place. Director Brian Bolster's beautifully filmed documentary echoes - quietly but gorgeously - the still-frame photography of his subject, but also shows us how her richly inspired outlook - looking out from the shores of this small island - has caused her to also look inward in ways most people only aspire to. Philosophical, contemplative, engaging, beautiful and engaging, this short film fits informally into a trilogy of sorts created by Brian Bolster as he shares the lives of people working for extended periods in isolated environments, who have - in their solitude - become not only deeply connected to their "place", but who have somehow deepened their connection to the wider world as well.

165 ::: Busted: The Citizen's Guide to Surviving Police Encounters (2004) ::: Most people don't know their basic constitutional rights, and those who do usually waive them in the face of police intimidation. Worse, police rely on people's fear and ignorance of the law to trick them into waiving their rights, which often lands them in jail. That's why Flex Your Rights (FyR) -- a Washington, DC-based educational group -- created BUSTED: The Citizen's Guide to Surviving Police Encounters. This fun 45-minute educational DVD realistically depicts three common police scenarios -- traffic stop, street stop, and home entry. Narrator Ira Glasser, a former ACLU executive director, shows you how to avoid cops' "gotcha games" as they try to trick you into waiving your rights; how to be courteous but not intimidated by police tactics; and how phrases such as "I don't consent to any searches" can keep you out of jail. According to Steve Silverman, BUSTED's writer and FyR's executive director, "We made BUSTED for anyone who's afraid that their looks or lifestyle makes them a target for law enforcement. This includes skaters, smokers, rockers, and freedom-loving badasses of all sorts."
166 ::: The Passion of the Mao (2006) ::: Who knew that Communism could be so funny? This madcap documentary reexamines the Cultural Revolution and restores the once bright reputation of Mao Zedong. "The Passion of the Mao" begins by correcting misconceptions about Mao's early years. Unlike the tyrants with whom he is usually compared, Mao was a successful scholar and businessman before he became a rabble-rouser. By the mid1950s, he had unified China, spurred an impressive rate of growth, restructured the education system, and improved living standards. Then he became a Maoist. Mao devoted the rest of his life to eliminating the centralized Soviet bureaucracy he and his colleagues had built. The film takes viewers back to the 1960s. Successful women and men, some now professors at major universities in the West, credit Mao and especially the Cultural Revolution for making them feminists and allowing them access to education. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao brought Western-style ballets and operas, reinterpreted in Chinese form, to China's villages. Peasants chose leaders who represented their true interests, and rural communities built schools independent of the central government. And what about the anti-Maoist beliefs that have sullied the reputation of the man once referred to as "the sun in the sky?" They are part of a vast radical conspiracy, the result of propaganda churned out by the same people who turned the tanks on the Tiananmen demonstrators.
